## Retrospective Sprint 3

###Start doing
* Decide on a more uniform coding style and commit messages.

###Stop doing
* Taking only indoor breaks.


###Keep doing
* Creating issues in git when bugs are found.

* Use the eclipse formatter when saving files.

* Discussing the relevant content and learnings from the PO meeting videos. 

* Making pull requests and doing code reviews instead of pushing directly to master.

* Work earlier in the sprint in case we have underestimated the amount of work that needs to be put in.

* Work in close proximity to each other as this enables easy communication and decisions are made quickly.

* Book long (3 hours or more) coding sessions. More time is spent on coding and making design decisions as fewer recaps are done and there is more time to discuss different ideas that come up throughout the work.

* Stay in touch throughout the entire sprint.

* Inform each other about what we are working on in order to avoid merge conflicts.

* Plan out the work before getting started with coding.
