## Retrospective Sprint 2

###Start doing
* Decide on a more uniform coding style and commit messages.

* Estimate amount of effort needed to complete a sprint and then decide how much of our time can be spent on it.


* Taking more breaks.

###Stop doing
* Not discussing the content and learnings from the PO meeting videos. Instead we should watch the videos (individually or together) and discuss the content. 


###Keep doing
* Making pull requests and doing code reviews instead of pushing directly to master.

* Work earlier in the sprint in case we have underestimated the amount of work that needs to be put in.

* Work in close proximity to each other as this enables easy communication and decisions are made quickly.

* Book long (3 hours or more) coding sessions. More time is spent on coding and making design decisions as fewer recaps are done and there is more time to discuss different ideas that come up throughout the work.

* Stay in touch throughout the entire sprint.

* Inform each other about what we are working on in order to avoid merge conflicts.

* Plan out the work before getting started with coding.
